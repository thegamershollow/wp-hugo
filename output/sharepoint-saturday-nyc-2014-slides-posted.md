Thank you to everyone who attended the sessions I did with Beatrice Baciu on Leveraging User Profiles in 2010 and 2013. We had a great weekend. Thanks to the organizers for having us down. Looking forward to next year.

If you are looking for the slides I have posted them [here](http://slidesha.re/UIpIKq).
