I know this is a little late but we are still within the realm timeliness here. This is the beginning of a new year. And with new beginnings there is change. I have spent a lot of time over the last few years trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had moved very strongly down the management track running teams of developers mainly in the SharePoint space. The farther I got down that track the farther I got from what I truly love which is writing code.

So with this new year, I am overjoyed to announce that I have joined the kick ass team at [Sympraxis Consulting.](https://sympraxisconsulting.com/)Â I have known [Marc Anderson](https://sympmarc.com/) for years through the SharePoint community and used SPServices more times than I can count. [Julie Turner](http://julieturner.net/) and I have worked together in several capacities for the better part of 8 years. When they suggested that I join them it was a no brainer for me. I am excited to bring my user-centric approach to design and development to the team and work together to do great things

So, to new beginnings!!! I guess that makes me the new kid on the block at Sympraxis. I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up but at least I'll have some fun in the mean time.
